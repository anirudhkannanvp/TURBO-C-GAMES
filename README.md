# TURBO-C-GAMES
This is a set of 4 C++ games(HANGMAN,NUMBER PUZZLE,CONNECT 4,TIC TAC TOE) done in TURBO C++ for Class 11 Computer Science CBSE PROJECT. 

This was a group project(group of 3) in which I mainly worked on NUMBER PUZZLE and the graphics and logic part in all the other games.

This Project is written is Turbo-c++ and should be compiled and ran using TURBO-C++ compiler.

I'll happily accept any pull requests if you want to add a valid feature in the game.

If you find any issues with the solutions in the repository, open an issue and I'll check it out ASAP.
